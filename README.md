# Herbs-n-Plants
The solution comprises three projects: a web app, a web API, and an Identity Server obtained from Duende. The main idea of the solution is to identify plants based on their color and provide a list of plants corresponding to the specified properties.

Additionally, users, considered as contributors, can add their own plants to the underlying database along with provided pictures. The administrator's authority includes performing any CRUD operations with plants.

Technologies used:
- Frontend:  
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- Backend:  
ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, PostgreSQL, RESTful API, External Imgur API, Identity Server
